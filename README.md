This is a supply buildpack that will detect the bounded redis service instance and modifies the `web.config` with the `sessionState` and `machineKey` sections.
- Uses Steeltoe connectors to build the connection configuration
- Any existing `sessionState` section(s) will be replaced with a custom one with valid connection string
- Any existing `machineKey` section(s) will be replaced with new validation and decryption keys

### Benefits of using this buildpack
- No code change required to persist session to redis, when pushing any ASP.NET application to PCF 
- So it reduces the effort in lifting and shifting a legacy ASP.NET application to PCF

### Pre-requisites
- PCF environment with redis tile in market place
- A redis service instance created
- `cf push` access to the PCF enviromnment

### Usage Instructions

To enable redis backed session in the application, please follow the below steps.
- Install nuget package `Microsoft.Web.RedisSessionStateProvider` in your application, preferrably the latest one.
- Add the buildpack in your application `manifest.yml` as in the example below. You can pick the latest release from https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/redis-session-aspnet-buildpack/releases

```yaml

- name: redis-buildpack-sample

  services:
   - my_redis_service
```
- To bind the application to the redis service to the application, add your redis service instance name in the `manifest.yml` as above
- Push the application to PCF, you will be seeing logs as below
